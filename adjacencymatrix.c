/*  ============= Tutorial on Graph format ============
    You are given a randomly generated graph that looks
    of the form:

    0 0 1 1 1
    1 0 0 1 1
    0 1 0 1 1
    1 0 0 0 0
    1 0 1 1 0

    You can think of the graph with labels for each of
    the nodes (sometimes called vertices) more clearly below:

               0 1 2 3 4
               ---------
    node 0:    0 0 1 1 1
    node 1:    1 0 0 1 1
    node 2:    0 1 0 1 1
    node 3:    1 0 0 0 0
    node 4:    1 0 1 1 0

    A '1' represents a connection to a node, and a 0
    means it is not connected.

               0 1 2 3 4
               ---------
    node 0:    0 0 1 1 1
    node 1:    1 0 0 1 1
    node 2:    0 1 0 1 1
    node 3:    1 0 0 0 0
    node 4:    1 0 1 1 0

    In the above, '0' is connected to 2, 3, and 4.
    That means node 0 has directed-edges out
    to nodes  2,3,and 4. In other words,
    the edge-list for node 0 is:
    0->2, 0->3, 0->4

    The number of connections a node has out is its 'out-degree'
    The number of connections a node has in are it's 'in-degree'
